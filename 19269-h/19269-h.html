from the same dust? That no one should exalt himself over the other.
Ponder at all times in your hearts how ye were created. Since We have
created you all from one same substance it is incumbent on you to be
even as one soul, to walk with the same feet, eat with the same mouth
and dwell in the same land, that from your inmost being, by your
deeds and actions, the signs of oneness and the essence of detachment
may be made manifest. Such is My counsel to you, O concourse of
light! Heed ye this counsel that ye may obtain the fruit of holiness
from the tree of wondrous glory.</p>

treasures of the earth, and that which the rulers and kings own, are
not equal in this day to the singing of His praise. The Lord of the
Kingdom beareth witness unto this at this glorious moment. And having
heard thy groaning and lamentation, We are responding with a Tablet
which calleth out betwixt earth and heaven and maketh mention of thee
with words that immortalize what hath appeared from thee in His love,
in His service, in His remembrance and in His praise. And He hath
made that which hath issued forth from thy mouth a trust with Him for
thee. He is verily the Most Bounteous, the Most Generous. If thou
truly givest ear to that which hath been revealed for thee from My
Supreme Pen at this moment, thou shalt soar with the wings of
eagerness in the heaven of love for the Lord of the Day of the
Covenant, and wilt say during all the days of thy life: Thanks be
unto Thee, O Thou the Desire of the world, and praise be unto Thee, O
Thou the Beloved of the people of understanding. May all existence be
a sacrifice for Thy favour, and all that hath been and will ever be,
a ransom for Thy Word, O Thou the Wronged One amongst the people of

is able to offer befitting gratitude for His successive bestowals and

slightest test visited him, he arose with such opposition and denial
as to cause the Concourse on high to moan and lament. Through the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the beginning of existence until the Promised Day
men retained superiority over women in every respect. It is revealed
in the Qur’án: “Men have superiority over women.”
But in this wondrous Dispensation, the supreme outpouring of the
Glorious Lord became the cause of manifest achievements by women.
Some handmaidens arose who excelled men in the arena of knowledge.
They arose with such love and spirituality that they became the cause
of the outpouring of the bounty of the Sovereign Lord upon mankind,
and with their sanctity, purity and attributes of the spirit led a
great many to the shore of unity. They became a guiding torch to the
wanderers in the wastes of bewilderment, and enkindled the despondent
in the nether world with the flame of the love of the Lord. This is a
bounteous characteristic of this wondrous Age which hath granted
strength to the weaker sex and hath bestowed masculine might upon
womanhood....</p>

which the Ancient Beauty and the Manifest Light—may my spirit
be sacrificed for His loved ones—hath risen from the horizon of
age-old hopes, women have assumed the attributes of men in showing
forth steadfastness in the Cause of God, and revealing the heroism
and might of fearless men. They invaded the arena of mystic knowledge
and hoisted aloft the banner on the heights of certitude. Thou, too,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The establishment of a women’s assemblage for the
promotion of knowledge is entirely acceptable, but discussions must
be confined to educational matters. It should be done in such a way
that differences will, day by day, be entirely wiped out, not that,
God forbid, it will end in argumentation between men and women. As in
the question of the veil, nothing should be done contrary to wisdom.
The individual women should, today, follow a course of action which
will be the cause of eternal glory to all womankind, so that all
women will be illumined. And that lieth in gathering to learn how to
teach, in holding meetings to recite the verses, to offer
supplications to the kingdom of the Lord of evident signs, and to
institute education for the girls. Ponder the manner in which
Jináb-i-Táhirih used to teach. She was free from every
concern, and for this reason she was resplendent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the world of women should be a spiritual world, not
a political one, so that it will be radiant. The women of other
nations are all immersed in political matters. Of what benefit is
this, and what fruit doth it yield? To the extent that ye can, ye
should busy yourselves with spiritual matters which will be conducive
to the exaltation of the Word of God and of the diffusion of His
fragrances. Your demeanour should lead to harmony amongst all and to
coalescence and the good-pleasure of all....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am endeavouring, with Bahá’u’lláh’s
confirmations and assistance, so to improve the world of the
handmaidens that all will be astonished. This progress is intended to
be in spirituality, in virtues, in human perfections and in divine
knowledge. In America, the cradle of women’s liberation, women
are still debarred from political institutions because they squabble.
They are yet to have a member in the House of Representatives. Also
Bahá’u’lláh hath proclaimed: “O ye
men of the House of Justice.” Ye need to be calm and composed,
so that the work will proceed with wisdom, otherwise there will be
such chaos that ye will leave everything and run away. “This
newly born babe is traversing in one night the path that needeth a
hundred years to tread.” In brief, ye should now engage in
matters of pure spirituality and not contend with men. ‘Abdu’l-Baha
will tactfully take appropriate steps. Be assured. In the end thou
wilt thyself exclaim, “This was indeed supreme wisdom!” I
appeal to you to obliterate this contention between men and women....

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Inasmuch as this is the century of light, it is evident
that the Sun of Reality, the Word, has revealed itself to all
humankind. One of the potentialities hidden in the realm of humanity
was the capability or capacity of womanhood. Through the effulgent
rays of divine illumination the capacity of woman has become so
awakened and manifest in this age that equality of man and woman is
an established fact....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this day man must investigate reality impartially and
without prejudice in order to reach the true knowledge and
conclusions. What, then, constitutes the inequality between man and
woman? Both are human. In powers and function each is the complement
of the other. At most it is this: that woman has been denied the
opportunities which man has so long enjoyed, especially the privilege
of education....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The truth is that all mankind are the creatures and
servants of one God, and in His estimate all are human. Man is a
generic term applying to all humanity. The biblical statement “Let
us make man in our image, after our likeness” does not mean
that woman was not created. The image and likeness of God apply to
her as well. In Persian and Arabic there are two distinct words
translated into English as man: one meaning man and woman
collectively, the other distinguishing man as male from woman the
female. The first word and its pronoun are generic, collective; the
other is restricted to the male. This is the same in Hebrew.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To accept and observe a distinction which God has not
intended in creation is ignorance and superstition....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is my hope that the banner of equality may be raised
throughout the five continents where as yet it is not fully
recognized and established. In this enlightened world of the West
woman has advanced an immeasurable degree beyond the women of the
Orient. And let it be known once more that until woman and man
recognize and realize equality, social and political progress here or
anywhere will not be possible. For the world of humanity consists of
two parts or members: one is woman; the other is man. Until these two
members are equal in strength, the oneness of humanity cannot be
established, and the happiness and felicity of mankind will not be a
reality. God willing, this is to be so.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Today questions of the utmost importance are facing
humanity, questions peculiar to this radiant century....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of these questions concerns the rights of woman and
her equality with man. In past ages it was held that woman and man
were not equal—that is to say, woman was considered inferior to
man, even from the standpoint of her anatomy and creation. She was
considered especially inferior in intelligence, and the idea
prevailed universally that it was not allowable for her to step into
the arena of important affairs. In some countries man went so far as
to believe and teach that woman belonged to a sphere lower than
human. But in this century, which is the century of light and the
revelation of mysteries, God is proving to the satisfaction of
humanity that all this is ignorance and error; nay, rather, it is
well established that mankind and womankind as parts of composite
humanity are coequal and that no difference in estimate is allowable,
for all are human. The conditions in past centuries were due to
woman’s lack of opportunity. She was denied the right and
privilege of education and left in her undeveloped state. Naturally,
she could not and did not advance. In reality, God has created all
mankind, and in the estimation of God there is no distinction as to
male and female. The one whose heart is pure is acceptable in His
sight, be that one man or woman. God does not inquire, “Art
thou woman or art thou man?” He judges human actions. If these
are acceptable in the threshold of the Glorious One, man and woman
will be equally recognized and rewarded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The world of humanity consists of two parts: male and
female. Each is the complement of the other. Therefore, if one is
defective, the other will necessarily be incomplete, and perfection
cannot be attained. There is a right hand and a left hand in the
human body, functionally equal in service and administration. If
either proves defective, the defect will naturally extend to the
other by involving the completeness of the whole; for accomplishment
is not normal unless both are perfect. If we say one hand is
deficient, we prove the inability and incapacity of the other; for
single-handed there is no full accomplishment. Just as physical
accomplishment is complete with two hands, so man and woman, the two
parts of the social body, must be perfect. It is not natural that
either should remain undeveloped; and until both are perfected, the
happiness of the human world will not be realized.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The status of woman in former times was exceedingly
deplorable, for it was the belief of the Orient that it was best for
woman to be ignorant. It was considered preferable that she should
not know reading or writing in order that she might not be informed
of events in the world. Woman was considered to be created for
rearing children and attending to the duties of the household. If she
pursued educational courses, it was deemed contrary to chastity;
hence women were made prisoners of the household. The houses did not
even have windows opening upon the outside world. Bahá’u’lláh
destroyed these ideas and proclaimed the equality of man and woman.
He made woman respected by commanding that all women be educated,
that there be no difference in the education of the two sexes and
that man and woman share the same rights. In the estimation of God
there is no distinction of sex. One whose thought is pure, whose
education is superior, whose scientific attainments are greater,
whose deeds of philanthropy excel, be that one man or woman, white or
colored, is entitled to full rights and recognition; there is no
differentiation whatsoever....</p>

though God had given His authority for such a course of action? If

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh,
women are advancing side by side with men. There is no area or
instance where they will lag behind: they have equal rights with men,
and will enter, in the future, into all branches of the
administration of society. Such will be their elevation that, in
every area of endeavour, they will occupy the highest levels in the
human world. Rest thou assured. Look not upon their present state. In
future, the world of womankind will shine with lustrous brilliance,
for such is the will and purpose of Bahá’u’lláh.
At the time of elections the right to vote is the inalienable right
of women, and the entrance of women into all human departments is an
irrefutable and incontrovertible question. No soul can retard or
prevent it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there are certain matters, the participation in
which is not worthy of women. For example, at the time when the
community is taking up vigorous defensive measures against the attack
of foes, the women are exempt from military engagements. It may so
happen that at a given time warlike and savage tribes may furiously
attack the body politic with the intention of carrying on a wholesale
slaughter of its members; under such a circumstance defence is
necessary, but it is the duty of men to organize and execute such
defensive measures and not the women—because their hearts are
tender and they cannot endure the sight of the horror of carnage,
even if it is for the sake of defence. From such and similar
undertakings the women are exempt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the constitution of the House of Justice,
Bahá’u’lláh addresses the men. He says: “O
ye men of the House of Justice!”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But when its members are to be elected, the right which
belongs to women, so far as their voting and their voice is
concerned, is indisputable. When the women attain to the ultimate
degree of progress, then, according to the exigency of the time and
place and their great capacity, they shall obtain extraordinary
privileges. Be ye confident on these accounts. His Holiness
Bahá’u’lláh has greatly strengthened the
cause of women, and the rights and privileges of women is one of the
greatest principles of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Rest ye
assured! Ere long the days shall come when the men addressing the
women, shall say: ‘Blessed are ye! Blessed are ye! Verily ye
are worthy of every gift. Verily ye deserve to adorn your heads with
the crown of everlasting glory, because in sciences and arts, in
virtues and perfections ye shall become equal to man, and as regards
tenderness of heart and the abundance of mercy and sympathy ye are
superior’.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The woman of the East has progressed. Formerly in India,
Persia and throughout the Orient, she was not considered a human
being. Certain Arab tribes counted their women in with the live
stock. In their language the noun for woman also meant donkey; that
is, the same name applied to both and a man’s wealth was
accounted by the number of these beasts of burden he possessed. The
worst insult one could hurl at a man was to cry out, “Thou
woman!”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the moment Bahá’u’lláh
appeared, this changed. He did away with the idea of distinction
between the sexes, proclaiming them equal in every capacity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In former times it was considered wiser that woman
should not know how to read or write; she should occupy herself only
with drudgery. She was very ignorant. Bahá’u’lláh
declares the education of woman to be of more importance than that of
man. If the mother be ignorant, even if the father have great
knowledge, the child’s education will be at fault, for
education begins with the milk. A child at the breast is like a
tender branch that the gardener can train as he wills.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The East has begun to educate its women. Some there are
in Persia who have become liberated through this cause, whose
cleverness and eloquence the ‘ulamá cannot refute. Many
of them are poets. They are absolutely fearless.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I hope for a like degree of progress among the women of
Europe—that each may shine like unto a lamp; that they may cry
out the proclamation of the kingdom; that they may truly assist the
men; nay, that they may be even superior to the men, versed in
sciences and yet detached, so that the whole world may bear witness
to the fact that men and women have absolutely the same rights. It
would be a cause of great joy for me to see such women. This is
useful work; by it woman will enter into the kingdom. Otherwise,
there will be no results.</p>

has dominated over woman by reason of his more forceful and
aggressive qualities both of body and mind. But the balance is
already shifting; force is losing its dominance, and mental
alertness, intuition, and the spiritual qualities of love and
service, in which woman is strong, are gaining ascendancy. Hence the
new age will be an age less masculine and more permeated with the
feminine ideals, or, to speak more exactly, will be an age in which
the masculine and feminine elements of civilization will be more
evenly balanced.</p>

the Universal House of Justice: there is a Tablet from ‘Abdul-Bahá
in which He definitely states that the membership of the Universal
House is confined to men, and that the wisdom of it will be fully
revealed and appreciated in the future. In the local as well as the
national Houses of Justice, however, women have the full right of
membership. It is, therefore, only to the International House that
they cannot be elected. The Bahá’ís should accept
this statement of the Master in a spirit of deep faith, confident
that there is a divine guidance and wisdom behind it which will be
gradually unfolded to the eyes of the world.</p>

manifest as the sun in the future. In any case the believers should
know that, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself has explicitly
stated that sexes are equal except in some cases, the exclusion of
women from the International House of Justice should not be
surprising. From the fact that there is no equality of functions
between the sexes one should not, however, infer that either sex is
inherently superior or inferior to the other, or that they are
unequal in their rights.</p>

women, this, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has often explained,
is a fundamental principle of Bahá’u’lláh;
therefore the Laws of the “Aqdas” should be studied in
the light of it. Equality between men and women does not, indeed
physiologically it cannot, mean identity of functions. In some things
women excel men, for others men are better fitted than women, while
in very many things the difference of sex is of no effect at all. The
differences of function are most apparent in family life. The
capacity for motherhood has many far-reaching implications which are
recognized in Bahá’í Law. For example, when it is
not possible to educate all one’s children, daughters receive
preference over sons, as mothers are the first educators of the next
generation. Again, for physiological reasons, women are granted
certain exemptions from fasting that are not applicable to men.</p>

He taught that the qualities and functions of men and women

mother who rears, nurtures and guides the growth of the child. This
is not the function of the father. If the educator be incompetent,
the educated will be correspondingly lacking. This is evident and
incontrovertible. Could the student be brilliant and accomplished if

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been objected by some that woman is not equally
capable with man and that she is deficient by creation. This is pure
imagination. The difference in capability between man and woman is
due entirely to opportunity and education. Heretofore woman has been
denied the right and privilege of equal development. If equal
opportunity be granted her, there is no doubt she would be the peer
of man. History will evidence this. In past ages noted women have
arisen in the affairs of nations and surpassed men in their
accomplishments....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The purpose, in brief, is this: that if woman be fully
educated and granted her rights, she will attain the capacity for
wonderful accomplishments and prove herself the equal of man. She is
the coadjutor of man, his complement and helpmeet. Both are human;
both are endowed with potentialities of intelligence and embody the
virtues of humanity. In all human powers and functions they are
partners and coequals. At present in spheres of human activity woman
does not manifest her natal prerogatives, owing to lack of education
and opportunity. Without doubt education will establish her equality
with men....</p>

will disappear....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Why should a woman be left mentally undeveloped? Science
is praiseworthy—whether investigated by the intellect of man or
woman. So, little by little, woman advanced, giving increasing
evidence of equal capabilities with man—whether in scientific
research, political ability or any other sphere of human activity.
The conclusion is evident that woman has been outdistanced through
lack of education and intellectual facilities. If given the same
educational opportunities or course of study, she would develop the
same capacity and abilities.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bahá’u’lláh has announced that
inasmuch as ignorance and lack of education are barriers of
separation among mankind, all must receive training and instruction.
Through this provision the lack of mutual understanding will be
remedied and the unity of mankind furthered and advanced. Universal
education is a universal law. It is, therefore, incumbent upon every
father to teach and instruct his children according to his
possibilities. If he is unable to educate them, the body politic, the
representative of the people, must provide the means for their
education.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sex distinction which exists in the human world is
due to the lack of education for woman, who has been denied equal
opportunity for development and advancement. Equality of the sexes
will be established in proportion to the increased opportunities
afforded woman in this age, for man and woman are equally the
recipients of powers and endowments from God, the Creator. God has
not ordained distinction between them in His consummate purpose.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cause of universal education, which has already
enlisted in its service an army of dedicated people from every faith
and nation, deserves the utmost support that the governments of the
world can lend it. For ignorance is indisputably the principal reason
for the decline and fall of peoples and the perpetuation of
prejudice. No nation can achieve success unless education is accorded
all its citizens. Lack of resources limits the ability of many
nations to fulfil this necessity, imposing a certain ordering of
priorities. The decision-making agencies involved would do well to
consider giving first priority to the education of women and girls,
since it is through educated mothers that the benefits of knowledge
can be most effectively and rapidly diffused throughout society. In
keeping with the requirements of the times, consideration should also
be given to teaching the concept of world citizenship as part of the
standard education of every child.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You have asked whether a husband would be able to
prevent his wife from embracing the divine light or a wife dissuade
her husband from gaining entry into the Kingdom of God. In truth
neither of them could prevent the other from entering into the
Kingdom, unless the husband hath an excessive attachment to the wife
or the wife to the husband. Indeed when either of the two worshippeth
the other to the exclusion of God, then each could prevent the other
from seeking admittance into His Kingdom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Question: What is the attitude of your belief toward the
family?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Answer: According to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
the family, being a human unit, must be educated according to the
rules of sanctity. All the virtues must be taught the family. The
integrity of the family bond must be constantly considered, and the
rights of the individual members must not be transgressed. The rights
of the son, the father, the mother—none of them must be
transgressed, none of them must be arbitrary. Just as the son has
certain obligations to his father, the father, likewise, has certain
obligations to his son. The mother, the sister and other members of
the household have their certain prerogatives. All these rights and
prerogatives must be conserved, yet the unity of the family must be
sustained. The injury of one shall be considered the injury of all;
the comfort of each, the comfort of all; the honor of one, the honor
of all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When such difference of opinion and belief occurs
between husband and wife it is very unfortunate for undoubtedly it
detracts from that spiritual bond which is the stronghold of the
family bond, especially in times of difficulty. The way, however,
that it could be remedied is not by acting in such wise as to
alienate the other party. One of the objects of the Cause is actually
to bring about a closer bond in the homes. In all such cases,
therefore, the Master used to advise obedience to the wishes of the
other party and prayer. Pray that your husband may gradually see the
light and at the same time so act as to draw him nearer rather than
prejudice him. Once that harmony is secured then you will be able to
serve unhampered.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In considering the problems that you and your wife are
experiencing, the House of Justice points out that the unity of your
family should take priority over any other consideration. Bahá’u’lláh
came to bring unity to the world, and a fundamental unity is that of
the family. Therefore, we must believe that the Faith is intended to
strengthen the family, not weaken it. For example, service to the
Cause should not produce neglect of the family. It is important for
you to arrange your time so that your family life is harmonious and
your household receives the attention it requires.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bahá’u’lláh also stressed the
importance of consultation. We should not think this worthwhile
method of seeking solutions is confined to the administrative
institutions of the Cause. Family consultation employing full and
frank discussion, and animated by awareness of the need for
moderation and balance, can be the panacea for domestic conflict.
Wives should not attempt to dominate their husbands, nor husbands
their wives....</p>

happiness. However, it is not something that just happens. For
marriage to become a haven of contentment it requires the cooperation
of the marriage partners themselves, and the assistance of their

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The members of a family all have duties and
responsibilities towards one another and to the family as a whole,
and these duties and responsibilities vary from member to member
because of their natural relationships. The parents have the
inescapable duty to educate their children—but not vice versa;
the children have the duty to obey their parents—the parents do
not obey the children; the mother—not the father—bears
the children, nurses them in babyhood, and is thus their first
educator; hence daughters have a prior right to education over sons
and, as the Guardian’s secretary has written on his behalf,
“The task of bringing up a Bahá’í child, as
emphasized time and again in Bahá’í Writings, is
the chief responsibility of the mother, whose unique privilege is
indeed to create in her home such conditions as would be most
conducive to both his material and spiritual welfare and advancement.
The training which a child first receives through his mother
constitutes the strongest foundation for his future development...”
A corollary of this responsibility of the mother is her right to be
supported by her husband—a husband has no explicit right to be
supported by his wife....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In any group, however loving the consultation, there are
nevertheless points on which, from time to time, agreement cannot be
reached. In a Spiritual Assembly this dilemma is resolved by a
majority vote. There can, however, be no majority where only two
parties are involved, as in the case of a husband and wife. There
are, therefore, times when a wife should defer to her husband, and
times when a husband should defer to his wife, but neither should
ever unjustly dominate the other. In short, the relationship between
husband and wife should be as held forth in the prayer revealed by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá which is often read at Bahá’í
weddings: “Verily, they are married in obedience to Thy
command. Cause them to become the signs of harmony and unity until
the end of time.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are all relationships within the family, but there
is a much wider sphere of relationships between men and women than in
the home, and this too we should consider in the context of Bahá’í
society, not in that of past or present social norms. For example,
although the mother is the first educator of the child, and the most
important formative influence in his development, the father also has
the responsibility of educating his children, and this responsibility
is so weighty that Bahá’u’lláh has stated
that a father who fails to exercise it forfeits his rights of
fatherhood. Similarly, although the primary responsibility for
supporting the family financially is placed upon the husband, this
does not by any means imply that the place of woman is confined to
the home....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to your question whether mothers should work
outside the home, it is helpful to consider the matter from the
perspective of the concept of a Bahá’í family.
This concept is based on the principle that the man has primary
responsibility for the financial support of the family, and the woman
is the chief and primary educator of the children. This by no means
implies that these functions are inflexibly fixed and cannot be
changed and adjusted to suit particular family situations, nor does
it mean that the place of the woman is confined to the home. Rather,
while primary responsibility is assigned, it is anticipated that
fathers would play a significant role in the education of the
children and women could also be breadwinners. As you rightly
indicated, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá encouraged women to
“participate fully and equally in the affairs of the world”.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In relation to your specific queries, the decision
concerning the amount of time a mother may spend in working outside

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great importance attached to the mother’s role
derives from the fact that she is the first educator of the child.
Her attitude, her prayers, even what she eats and her physical
condition have a great influence on the child when it is still in the
womb. When the child is born, it is she who has been endowed by God
with the milk which is the first food designed for it, and it is
intended that, if possible, she should be with the baby to train and
nurture it in its earliest days and months. This does not mean that
the father does not also love, pray for, and care for his baby, but
as he has the primary responsibility of providing for the family, his
time to be with his child is usually limited, while the mother is
usually closely associated with the baby during this intensely
formative time when it is growing and developing faster than it ever
will again during the whole of its life. As the child grows older and
more independent, the relative nature of its relationship with its
mother and father modifies and the father can play a greater role.</p>

equal capacity and importance with man in the social and economic

humanity has been defective and inefficient because it has been
incomplete. War and its ravages have blighted the world; the
education of woman will be a mighty step toward its abolition and
ending, for she will use her whole influence against war. Woman rears
the child and educates the youth to maturity. She will refuse to give
her sons for sacrifice upon the field of battle. In truth, she will
be the greatest factor in establishing universal peace and
international arbitration. Assuredly, woman will abolish warfare
among mankind....</p>

and beyond disproof even in religion. Jesus Christ had twelve
disciples and among His followers a woman known as Mary Magdalene.
Judas Iscariot had become a traitor and hypocrite, and after the
crucifixion the remaining eleven disciples were wavering and
undecided. It is certain from the evidence of the Gospels that the

Magdalene.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Question: Is it not a fact that universal peace cannot

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Answer: It is very evident that in the future there
shall be no centralization in the countries of the world, be they
constitutional in government, republican or democratic in form. The
United States may be held up as the example of future government—that
is to say, each province will be independent in itself, but there
will be federal union protecting the interests of the various
independent states. It may not be a republican or a democratic form.
To cast aside centralization which promotes despotism is the exigency
of the time. This will be productive of international peace. Another
fact of equal importance in bringing about international peace is
woman’s suffrage. That is to say, when perfect equality shall
be established between men and women, peace may be realized for the
simple reason that womankind in general will never favor warfare.
Women will not be willing to allow those whom they have so tenderly
cared for to go to the battlefield. When they shall have a vote, they
will oppose any cause of warfare. Another factor which will bring
about universal peace is the linking together of the Orient and the
Occident.</p>

Woman by nature is opposed to war; she is an advocate of peace.
Children are reared and brought up by the mothers who give them the
first principles of education and labor assiduously in their behalf.
Consider, for instance, a mother who has tenderly reared a son for
twenty years to the age of maturity. Surely she will not consent to
having that son torn asunder and killed in the field of battle.
Therefore, as woman advances toward the degree of man in power and
privilege, with the right of vote and control in human government,
most assuredly war will cease; for woman is naturally the most
devoted and staunch advocate of international peace.</p>

affects women, and when they form a conscious and overwhelming mass
of public opinion against war there can be no war. The Bahá’í
women are already organized through being members of the Faith and
the Administrative Order. No further organization is needed. But they
should, through teaching and through the active moral support they
give to every movement directed towards peace, seek to exert a strong
influence on other women’s minds in regard to this essential
matter.</p>

equality between the sexes, is one of the most important, though less

perpetrates an injustice against one half of the world’s
population and promotes in men harmful attitudes and habits that are
carried from the family to the workplace, to political life, and
ultimately to international relations. There are no grounds, moral,
practical, or biological, upon which such denial can be justified.
Only as women are welcomed into full partnership in all fields of
human endeavour will the moral and psychological climate be created
in which international peace can emerge.</p>

first educator of the child, and the most important formative
influence in his development, the father also has the responsibility
of educating his children, and this responsibility is so weighty that
Bahá’u’lláh has stated that a father who
fails to exercise it forfeits his rights of fatherhood. Similarly,
although the primary responsibility for supporting the family
financially is placed upon the husband, this does not by any means
imply that the place of woman is confined to the home. On the
contrary, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated:</p>

women are advancing side by side with men. There is no area or
instance where they will lag behind: they have equal rights with men,

with the handmaiden who hath hearkened to His Voice and become of the
blissful. Verily, she is a champion of the field of true
understanding. To this the Tongue of Truth beareth witness from His
exalted Station.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">O My leaf, blessed art thou for having responded to My

thee and upon the one who hath guided thee to My straight path.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The effulgence of the rays of the Sun of Truth is
abundant and the favours of the Blessed Beauty surround the women
believers and the handmaidens who have attained unto certitude. At
every moment a bounteous bestowal is revealed. The handmaidens of the
Merciful should seize the opportunities afforded in these days. Each
one should strive to draw nigh unto the divine Threshold and seek
bounties from the Source of existence. She should attain such a state
and be confirmed with such a power as to make, with but the utterance
of one word, a lowly person to be held in reverence, initiate him who
is deprived into the world of the spirit, impart hope to the
despondent, endow the portionless one with a share of the great
bestowal, and confer knowledge and insight upon the ignorant and the
blind, and alertness and vigilance on the indolent and heedless. This
is the attribute of the handmaidens of the Merciful. This is the
characteristic of the bondsmaids of God’s Threshold.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">O ye leaves who have attained certitude! In the
countries of Europe and America the maidservants of the Merciful have
won the prize of excellence and advancement from the arena of men,
and in the fields of teaching and spreading the divine fragrances
they have shown a brilliant hand. Soon they will soar like the birds
of the Concourse on high in the far corners of the world and will
guide the people and reveal to them the divine mysteries. Ye, who are
the blessed leaves from the East, should burn more brightly, and
engage in spreading the sweet savours of the Lord and in reciting the
verses of God. Arise, therefore, and exert yourselves to fulfil the
exhortations and counsels of the Blessed Beauty, that all hopes may
be realized and that the plain of streams and orchards may become the
garden of oneness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this great Cycle and wondrous Dispensation some women
have been raised up who were the emblems of unity and ensigns of
oneness, for the revelation of divine bestowals is received by men
and women in equal measure. “Verily the most honoured in the
sight of God is the most virtuous amongst you”<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>
is applicable to both men and women, to servants and handmaidens. All
are under the shadow of the Word of God and all derive their strength
from the bounties of the Lord. Therefore, do not consider thyself to
be insignificant by doubting what a handmaiden living behind the veil
can do....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a firm heart, a steadfast step and an eloquent
tongue arise to spread the Word of God and say: “O God,
although I am sitting concealed behind the screen of chastity and am
restricted by the veil and exigencies of modesty, my cherished hope
is to raise the banner of service and to become a maidservant at Thy
Holy Threshold; to ride on a charger and penetrate the army of the
ignorant, defeat the mighty regiments and subvert the foundations of
error and violation. Thou art the Helper of the weak, Thou art the
Sustainer of the poor, Thou art the Succourer of the handmaidens.
Verily, Thou art the Almighty and All-Powerful.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Confirmations from the kingdom of God will assuredly be
received, enabling some radiant leaves to appear resplendent in the
assemblage of this world with clear proofs and convincing reasons,
which will adorn the cause of womanhood. They will prove that in this
cycle women are equal to men, nay, in certain respects they will
excel. Ponder ye: in this wonderful Cause numerous were the men who
scaled the heights of knowledge; they had a brilliant utterance, a
convincing proof, an eloquent tongue and magnificent speech, but the
blessed leaf, Jináb-i-Táhirih, because she was a woman,
emerged with immense splendour and dumbfounded all the people. If she
were a man, this would not have been so at all. Therefore, ye should
know that the greatness of the Cause hath penetrated the nerves and
veins of the world in such wise that if one of the leaves is
attracted and gains mastery in demonstrating reasons and proofs and
in uttering convincing evidences, she will shine resplendently. O
radiant leaves, I swear by the Beauty of the Desired One and the
Mystery of Existence that if ye work actively in this realm, the
outpourings of the Blessed Beauty will reflect as the sun in the
mirrors of the hearts. Your progress will astonish all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The attracted leaves should not, when associating with
each other, talk merely about the temperature of the weather, the
coldness of the water, the beauty of the flowers and gardens, the
freshness of the grass and the flowing water. They should rather
restrict their discussions to glorification and praise and the
uttering of proofs and reasons, to quoting verses and traditions and
putting forth clear testimonies, so that all the homes of the loved
ones will be converted into gathering places for lessons on teaching
the Cause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If ye do so, in a short while the outpourings of the
Kingdom will be so manifested that each one of the handmaidens of the
Merciful will become a perspicuous book revealing the mysteries of
the Lord of Mercy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this wondrous Dispensation the favours of the

Therefore, they should, like unto men, seize the prize and excel in
the field, so that it will be proven and made manifest that the
penetrative influence of the Word of God in this new Dispensation
hath caused women to be equal with men, and that in the arena of
tests they will outdo others. Therefore, the true bondsmaids of the
Blessed Beauty must be revived by the spirit of detachment, and
refreshed by the breezes of attraction. With hearts overflowing with
the love of God, with souls gladdened by the heavenly glad-tidings,
and with extreme humility and lowliness, let them speak out with
eloquent speech, and praise and glorify the Great Lord, for they are
the manifestations of His bounty and adorned with the crown of
splendour.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Blessed, blessed are ye for ye have arranged spiritual
meetings and engaged in propounding divine proofs and evidences. Ye
are intent on vindicating truth in support of the manifest Light of
the Cause, through conclusive arguments and proofs based on the
sacred scriptures of the past. This is a very noble aim, and this
cherished hope a cause of the illumination of all peoples and
nations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the beginning of existence until the present day,
in any of the past cycles and dispensations, no assemblies for women
have ever been established and classes for the purpose of spreading
the teachings were never held by them. This is one of the
characteristics of this glorious Dispensation and this great century.
Ye should, most certainly, strive to perfect this assemblage and
increase your knowledge of the realities of heavenly mysteries, so
that, God willing, in a short time, women will become the same as
men; they will take a leading position amongst the learned, will each
have a fluent tongue and eloquent speech, and shine like unto lamps
of guidance throughout the world. In some respects, women have
astonishing capacities; they hasten in their attraction to God, and
are intense in their fiery ardour for Him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In brief, spend your nights and days in the study of the
holy Utterances and in acquiring perfections. Occupy yourselves
always in discussing these matters. When ye meet each other, convey
the glad-tidings and impart hope to one another because of the
confirmations and bounties of the Ancient and Ever-Living Lord. Let
each set forth proofs and evidences, and talk about the mysteries of
the Kingdom, so that the true and divine Spirit may permeate the body
of the contingent world and the secrets of all things, whether of the
past or of the future, may become openly manifest and resplendent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">O loved handmaidens of God! Consider not your present
merits and capacities, rather fix your gaze on the favours and
confirmations of the Blessed Beauty, because His everlasting grace
will make of the insignificant plant a blessed tree, will turn the
mirage into cool water and wine; will cause the forsaken atom to
become the very essence of being, the puny one erudite in the school
of knowledge. It enableth a thorny bush to give forth blossoms, and
the dark earth to produce fragrant and rich hyacinths. It will
transmute the stone into a ruby of great price, and fill the sea
shells with brilliant pearls. It will assist a fledgling schoolchild
to become a learned teacher and enable a frail embryo to reveal the
reality of the verse: “Hallowed be the Lord, the Most Excellent
of all creators.”<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>

Spiritual Assemblies to provide the mothers with a well-planned
programme for the education of children, showing how, from infancy,
the child must be watched over and taught. These instructions must be
given to every mother to serve her as a guide, so that each will
train and nurture her children in accordance with the Teachings.</p>

aspiration toward advancement will be checked by it, and she will
gradually become hopeless. On the contrary, we must declare that her
capacity is equal, even greater than man’s. This will inspire
her with hope and ambition, and her susceptibilities for advancement
will continually increase. She must not be told and taught that she
is weaker and inferior in capacity and qualification. If a pupil is
told that his intelligence is less than his fellow pupils, it is a
very great drawback and handicap to his progress. He must be
encouraged to advance by the statement, “You are most capable,
and if you endeavour, you will attain the highest degree.”</p>

Among these realities is the principle of the equality of man and
woman—equal rights and prerogatives in all things appertaining
to humanity. Bahá’u’lláh declared this
reality over fifty years ago. But while this principle of equality is
true, it is likewise true that woman must prove her capacity and
aptitude, must show forth the evidences of equality. She must become
proficient in the arts and sciences and prove by her accomplishments
that her abilities and powers have merely been latent. Demonstrations
of force, such as are now taking place in England, are neither
becoming nor effective in the cause of womanhood and equality. Woman
must especially devote her energies and abilities toward the
industrial and agricultural sciences, seeking to assist mankind in
that which is most needful. By this means she will demonstrate
capability and ensure recognition of equality in the social and
economic equation. Undoubtedly God will confirm her in her efforts
and endeavours, for in this century of radiance Bahá’u’lláh
has proclaimed the reality of the oneness of the world of humanity
and announced that all nations, peoples and races are one....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Europe women have made greater progress than in the
East, but there is still much to be done! When students have arrived
at the end of their school term an examination takes place, and the
result thereof determines the knowledge and capacity of each student.
So will it be with woman; her actions will show her power, there will
no longer be any need to proclaim it by words.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is my hope that women of the East, as well as their
Western sisters, will progress rapidly until humanity shall reach
perfection.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">God’s Bounty is for all and gives power for all
progress. When men own the equality of women there will be no need
for them to struggle for their rights! One of the principles then of
Bahá’u’lláh is the equality of sex.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Women must make the greatest effort to acquire spiritual
power and to increase in the virtue of wisdom and holiness until
their enlightenment and striving succeeds in bringing about the unity
of mankind. They must work with a burning enthusiasm to spread the
Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh among the peoples,
so that the radiant light of the Divine Bounty may envelop the souls
of all the nations of the world!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Regarding the position of the Bahá’í
women in India and Burma, and their future collaboration with the men
in the administrative work of the Cause, I feel that the time is now
ripe that those women who have already conformed to the prevailing
custom in India and Burma by discarding the veil should not only be
given the right to vote for the election of their local and national
representatives, but should themselves be eligible to the membership
of all Bahá’í Assemblies throughout India and
Burma, be they local or national.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This definite and most important step, however, should
be taken with the greatest care and caution, prudence and
thoughtfulness. Due regard must be paid to their actual capacity and
present attainments, and only those who are best qualified for
membership, be they men or women, and irrespective of social
standing, should be elected to the extremely responsible position of
a member of the Bahá’í Assembly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This momentous decision, I trust, will prove to be a
great incentive to the women Bahá’ís throughout
India and Burma who, I hope, will now bestir themselves and endeavour
to the best of their ability to acquire a better and more profound
knowledge of the Cause, to take a more active and systematic part in
the general affairs of the Movement, and prove themselves in every
way enlightened, responsible and efficient co-workers to their
fellow-men in their common task for the advancement of the Cause
throughout their country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">May they fully realize their high responsibilities in
this day, may they do all in their power to justify the high hopes we
cherish for their future, and may they prove themselves in every
respect worthy of the noble mission which the Bahá’í
world is now entrusting to their charge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">‘Abdu’l-Bahá has pointed out that
“Among the miracles which distinguish this sacred dispensation
is this, that women have evinced a greater boldness than men when
enlisted in the ranks of the Faith.” Shoghi Effendi has further
stated that this “boldness” must, in the course of time,
“be more convincingly demonstrated, and win for the beloved
Cause victories more stirring than any it has as yet achieved.”
Although obviously the entire Bahá’í world is
committed to encouraging and stimulating the vital rôle of
women in the Bahá’í community as well as in
society at large, the Five Year Plan calls specifically on eighty
National Spiritual Assemblies to organize Bahá’í
activities for women. In the course of the current year which has
been designated “International Women’s Year” as a
world-wide activity of the United Nations, the Bahá’ís,
particularly in these eighty national communities, should initiate
and implement programs which will stimulate and promote the full and
equal participation of women in all aspects of Bahá’í
community life, so that through their accomplishments the friends
will demonstrate the distinction of the Cause of God in this field of
human endeavour.</p>
